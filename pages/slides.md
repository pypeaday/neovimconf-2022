!!! vim-credit "Agenda 2"

    !!! centered-list ""

        * My set of "problems"
        * Philosophy behind those problems
        * Vim to the rescue
        * Credits

## Problem 0 - Notes

<!-- * Notes (church, courses, teaching, etc.) -->
!!! note "Notes (church, courses, teaching, etc.)"

    * OneNote
    * Logos Notes
    * Logos Sermon Editor
    * Notepad
    * Evernote
    * TiddlyWiki
    * LaTex

## Problem 1 - Distribution
<!-- * Distribution -->
!!! warning "Distribution"

    * Never understood how to share via Microsoft tooling
    * Logos Sermon Editor publishes to a URL, but the notes don't
    * Notepad?
    * TiddlyWiki kind of works in a git repo... kind of...
    * Manually making PPTs when necessary - c-c c-v from whichever source

## Problem 2 - Coding
<!-- * Code -->
!!! danger "Code"

    * MATLAB GUI
    * R + RStudio
    * Anaconda + Spyder
    * PyCharm (CE and Professional)
    * VS C*\*\*

!!! danger "LaTex"

    * TexWorks

## Problem 5 - Todos
<!-- * Code -->
!!! danger "TODOs"

    * Notebooks
    * AZDO boards
    * No, that other notebook
    * Texts to myself 
    * Found the right notebook...


## Problems - Summary

!!! note "My Woes"

    * Same computer (or software required on any machine)
    * Different backup strategies/mechanisms
    * Vendor lock-in from several angles
    * Disorganization
    * Windows ðŸ¤¢

## Philosophy

> Workflows have tools

> Tools are GUIs

> Click button = run code

## 

!!! success "Enter Neovim"

    * Literally changed how I think about interacting with a computer
    * Fast... like really fast
    * Opens doors for CLI tools
    * Forced education
        * python setup
        * tex setup


<!-- Notes: -->
<!-- 0. A computer no longer was just Windows or Mac... I moved into Linux around -->
<!--    the same time and began to conceptually understand what Windows offered, and -->
<!--    how I could get a more tailored experience of the only things I actually -->
<!--    want, out of a Linux environment -->
<!-- 1. Moving around in Vim is incredibly fast - using the mouse hurts my shoulder now -->
<!-- 2. Being in the terminal makes CLI tools natural (Waylon's talk) -->
<!-- 3. NOT using canned solutions, like VS C***, forced me to learn more about my -->
<!--    development workflow, understand the tools I use, configure them how I want, -->
<!--    and because I've done that I can now better coach others around me whether -->
<!--    they use vim or not -->



## Breakdown

    | Problem | Solution |
    | --- | --- |
    | Notes | Everything is git + Markdown | 
    | Distribution | Markata sites/slides <br/> (GH/Cloudflare or Self-host) |
    | Code | Vim customization <br /> Tmux usage <br /> CLI tools _right flipping there_ |
    | Todos | Markata-todoui <br /> Kanboard (collaboration) |

## TL;DR
